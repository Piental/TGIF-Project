      <h2>Senators</h2>
      <p>
        First convened in 1789, the composition and powers of the Senate are
        established in Article One of the U.S. Constitution. Each state is
        represented by two senators, regardless of population, who serve
        staggered six-year terms. The Senate has several exclusive powers not
        granted to the House, including consenting to treaties as a precondition
        to their ratification and consenting to or confirming appointments of
        Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, other federal executive officials,
        military officers, regulatory officials, ambassadors, and other federal
        uniformed officers, as well as trial of federal officials impeached by
        the House.
